This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, especially within a component that is rendered multiple times or before the layout is fully determined.  The issue stems from `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` returning inaccurate or inconsistent values during the initial render or when the app window changes size unexpectedly.
