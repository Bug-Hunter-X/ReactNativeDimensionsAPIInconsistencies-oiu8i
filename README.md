# Inconsistent Screen Dimensions in React Native

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to retrieve screen dimensions.  The problem lies in the API sometimes providing inaccurate values, especially during initial rendering or rapid component re-renders.  The provided solution illustrates a robust method to handle this scenario.

## Problem

The `Dimensions` API in React Native is prone to returning inaccurate or inconsistent dimensions, particularly:

* **During initial render:** The layout might not be fully determined, leading to incorrect measurements.
* **After orientation change:** When the screen rotates, the dimensions might be briefly incorrect before updating.
* **Rapid re-renders:** Frequent component updates can cause the API to provide outdated values.

This inconsistency often leads to layout issues, such as components rendered with the wrong size or position.

## Solution

The solution employs the `useEffect` hook and `Dimensions.addEventListener` to listen for changes to the window dimensions. By using the `LayoutAnimation` API, we can ensure that the transitions in the UI smoothly adapt to the changes in dimension.  This approach prioritizes getting the most updated dimension values, eliminating many of the inconsistencies.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` (or `npx react-native run-ios`) to start the app.

Observe the behavior of the component and how the solution addresses the dimensions inconsistency.
